# Scott-Pilgrim-Game
This repository is a collection of files that makeup a video-game I developed in Java. 
This game is modeled after the famous comic and film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.
While not fully developed, it will be able to tell a simplified version of the story and simulate fights between Scott and the evil-exes.
